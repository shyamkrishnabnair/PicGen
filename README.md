# 🖼️ PicGen - AI Image Generator

**PicGen** is a web application that allows users to generate AI images based on custom prompts. It uses the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) to generate images from text, supporting models like `prompthero/openjourney`. Users can choose the number of images, aspect ratio, and model — all through a clean and interactive frontend.

> ⚠️ API key security is handled by a secure Node.js backend. No secrets are exposed to the frontend.
